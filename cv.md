    ## About me
       * Hi, my name is Nino. I am a beginner frontend developer. I am 36 years old and live in Georgia.
       I am interested in your vacancy because I want to work on interesting projects, in a modern company with a cool team. I think that in your company I could learn a lot and grow professionally.
       From technologies I know JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, MobX, API, Github. Now I am learning Next.js and TypeScript by myself.
       I wrote several pet projects in JavaScript and React. Participated in several team projects. Mostly these were projects within the framework of training. One of the projects was for a real customer. We created a website for a law firm.
       I have 3 months of commercial experience working in a company as a front-end developer. I did an internship at 5D hub company. *
